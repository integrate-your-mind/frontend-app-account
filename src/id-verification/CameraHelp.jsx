          You may be able to complete the image capture procedure without assistance, but it may take a couple of submission attempts
          to get the camera positioning right. Optimal camera positioning varies with each computer, but generally the best position for
          a headshot is approximately 12-18 inches (30-45 centimeters) from the camera, with your head centered relative to the computer screen.
          If the photos you submit are rejected, try moving the computer or camera orientation to change the lighting angle. 
          The most common reason for rejection is in ability to read the text on the ID card.
